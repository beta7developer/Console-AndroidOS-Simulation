# Console-AndroidOS-Simulation
I am developing an OS simulation. Currently at build 398 (beta1)

# NOTE
This is not a real operating system as it can get me in trouble by lawsuits from Google.
So this is just a simulation for educational purposes.
Please, don't sue me for God's sake, I am young.

# DISCLAIMER
If I violated anything, please contact me at viethoang082013chess@outlook.com.vn, and I'll fix the issue requested from you lawyers.
This is just a project from my school that I personally developed myself.

(Google, I am begging you, please don't sue me)
